 * R5 core 1 control service.
 *
 * On the KR260 board R5c1 has no LED, so it uses the comm-only ControlService
 * behaviour unchanged: SET_LED is accepted as an ACK no-op and the LED status
 * fields report zero (the base-class defaults). This subclass exists for
 * symmetry with R5c0Service and as a home for any future R5c1-specific
 * message handling (override handle_custom()).
